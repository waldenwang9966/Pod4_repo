<p class="green font_verdana">Hello my name is Donell nickame Nell for short. I grew up in The Bronx in New York City. I'm 22 years old & I love to go out have & fun but I also have alot of self discipline
so I know when to cut fun out. I'm also a tattoo apprentice. I love to listen to all gernes of music especially rap and R&B!
and I love basketball. I used to play basketball till high school when I ruptured my achilles tendon. Since I was a kid my favorite basketball
player was Russell Westbrook. I felt like he always put it all into the game of basketball which always taught me I should put it all into anything I do in life.
Also I like to read books. I read alot of self books because I believe no matter what I can always self improve & learn new life skills.</p>
