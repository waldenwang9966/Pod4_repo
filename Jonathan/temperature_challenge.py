celsius_100 = (100 - 32) * 5/9 #assigned and saved value to variable
print (celsius_100) #print command to convert from F to C
#the answer to question number 12 is Float because there is a decimal point
celsius_0 = (0 - 32) * 5/9
print (celsius_0)
print (34.2 - 32 * 5/9)#coverted this tempurature from F to C without assigning to a variable all in one print statement
print (5 * 9/5 +32) # print statement,converted from C to F
print (30.2 * 9/5 +32) # converted C to F comes to 86.36F so 
#Answer to question number 22 is YES (30.2C) is hotter than (85.1F)
