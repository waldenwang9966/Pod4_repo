fahrenheit = 100 #temperature
celsius_100 = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
print (celsius_100)
#1 converting f-c is a float because of the decimal.
#once i converted celsius_100 to a variable I put in the formula and got my answer.

celsius_10 = 0
conversion = (celsius_10 - 32) * 5/9
print(conversion)
#once again I converted celsius_10 into a variable and put the same formula in. it's a float.

print(34.2 - 32 * 5/9)
#without any variables all I had to do was put 34.2 in the formula converting f to c.


print(5*9/5+32)


print (30.2 * 9/5 + 32)
#30.2 celsius is hotter than 85.1 fahrenheit
