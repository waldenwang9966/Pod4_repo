#2.5: printing the three point percentage for each player
jamal_m_percentage = 46 / 93
fred_v_percentage = 43 / 110
james_h_percentage = 37 / 109
# 3.1: Printed out the paragraph but with only 1 sentence per line
lakers_info ='The Lakers went all in this offseason and swung a deal for former Pelicans forward Anthony Davis. They sent a package of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, and 3 first-round picks to New Orleans to land Davis. Those three have made good developments with the Pelicans, especially Brandon Ingram. But, the deal is still a huge win for the Lakers as Lebron, Davis, and company have put together an incredible season. Los Angeles has ridden James and Davis, along with a supporting cast built around them, to the second-best record in the NBA. The Lakers ended the season atop the Western Conference with a record of 49-14. They were narrowly behind the Bucks for the best record in the league. Davis proved to the final piece necessary for the Lakers to rebound from missing the playoff√≠s last year. Los Angeles was a dominant club on both sides of the ball and are in a position to have another successful year next season.'

# 3.3
# made a variable called `lakers_are_best` to indicate this
lakers_are_best = False
#printed out the variable in an f-string to convey my opinion on the lakers
print(f"'The Lakers are the best basketball team in the NBA' is {lakers_are_best}!")

#3.4: Type Conversion
#Converted your `lakers_are_best` variable to an integer, and printed
print(int(lakers_are_best))
#Converted your `lakers_are best` variable to a float, and printed 
print(float(lakers_are_best)) 

#3.5: Type Conversion Part 2
#Attempted to take each player's 3-point percentage and convert it to a string, and print them out.
#I  was unable to convert it because only intergers can be converted to strings
print(str(jamal_m_percentage))
print(str(fred_v_percentage))
print(str(james_h_percentage))
#took each player's 3-point percentage and converted it to a string, but noticed it was rounded down to "0" there is no whole number to
# round up to. The larger numbers that could be rounded are after the decimal point.
